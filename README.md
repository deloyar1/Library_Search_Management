# Library_Search_Management
Library Search Enhancement is a JavaFX-based desktop application designed to improve the search functionality in a library management system. Unlike traditional systems where incorrect or partial queries return no results, this project implements a similarity-based search mechanism. Users can find books or authors even if names are misspelled or incomplete, with results showing multiple close matches along with similarity percentages.

✨ Features

🎯 Enhanced Search – Suggests multiple close matches with similarity scores for misspelled or partial inputs

📂 File-Based Storage – Uses text files instead of databases for storing and managing book records

📚 Book Management – Add, view, update, and delete books with ease

🎨 JavaFX UI – Interactive and user-friendly graphical interface

⚡ Lightweight & Efficient – Simple implementation suitable for small-scale library systems

🛠️ Technologies Used

Java – Core programming language

JavaFX – GUI development

File Management – Persistent storage using text files

String Similarity Algorithms – For enhanced search accuracy

🚀 How It Works

User enters a book title or author name in the search field.

The system compares the input with stored records using similarity matching.

Multiple close results are displayed with a percentage of similarity.

Users can then view, select, or manage the desired book.

🎯 Project Goal

To provide a smart and user-friendly search mechanism for library systems using JavaFX and file management, making book discovery easier and more efficient.
